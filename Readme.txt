This project will use a jar to build and deploy this into an environment. It will wait for an input from a user (probably a QA) to approve the deployment post build job.

The Jobs from jenkins are in /Project_Path/jobs folder. These jobs need to be altered post import into jenkins since the folder structure from where the jobs are exported is different.
